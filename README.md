# Inauthentic Sans
Welcome to the authentic home of Inauthentic Sans.

(Font files coming soon)

Inauthentic Sans is my first attempt at type design, and its goal is to find a way to combat Modernist design impulses from within Modernist territory by subverting objective forms in sometimes extreme but mostly subtle ways.

There seem to be two versions of Inauthentic Sans beginning to form: a militant display face and a more subdued double-agent text face.
